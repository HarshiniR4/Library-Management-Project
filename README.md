# Library-Management-Project
Library Management project with Java, JavaFx, MySQL

## Components
The project has three major technical aspects:
•	Java GUI- utilizing the User interface features of Java a user-friendly interface for the user will be created. The GUI will incorporate interactive elements, such as buttons, forms, and menus, to guide users through various processes. This ensures that users can perform tasks with minimal effort and confusion. The GUI will enable non-technical users to access, modify, and update data as required for their needs without needing to understand the workings of the backend of the system.
•	SQL-based Database: SQL databases provide a structured way to organize and store data. In the LMS, this means that book information, user details, transaction records, and fine calculations are neatly organized and easily accessible. Utilizing the concept of Java Database (JDBC) Programming along with the concepts of MySQL, a reliable, consistent, and safe database will be created to enable the management of the library. The schema will be intricately designed to handle multiple facets of managing a library including details of books, librarians, shelves, reservations, and admin details.
•	Java-based Network Application- By using Java, we ensure that the LMS can be accessed and operated on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. This flexibility allows users to access the system from a wide range of devices. A network application built in Java can easily scale to accommodate the growing needs of the library. As the library collection expands, the LMS can seamlessly handle an increasing number of books, users, and transactions. This interface will act as a medium between the user interface and the database. It can support encryption, authentication, and access control, ensuring that only authorized users can access and modify data.
There will be three distinct access tiers to the system:
•	Admin: The system will be completely under the admins' control. They can oversee all library operations, handle books, and manage users.
•	Librarian: In addition to keeping track of the available books, librarians can handle book transactions including borrowing, returning, and making reservations.
•	Student: Books may be borrowed, returned, and reserved by students. Additionally, they can give books to the library.

## Stack
The following technologies will be employed in the development of the Library Management System:

•	Java: The main programming language used to create the application, offering object-oriented design concepts and platform freedom.
•	SQL: For database management to store data about books, users, transactions, and fines.
•	With the help of the Spring Framework, which enables aspect-oriented programming and dependency injection, one may construct a stable, scalable, and maintainable Java application.
•	Java Swing/AWT: Used to create a graphical user interface (GUI) that is easy to use and intuitive for users.

## Key Features
The Library Management System will include the following key features:
•	User Authentication and Authorization: Implementing role-based access control for Admins, Librarians, and Students. LMS will have user authentication for sensitive library data. Admins control access, Librarians manage books, and Students have limited access for borrowing, returning, and reserving books.

•	Book Management: Adding, updating, and deleting books, including details like title, author, ISBN, and quantity. The LMS allows librarians and administrators to add new books to the collection by specifying title, author, ISBN, genre, and quantity. The system tracks the quantity of each book and updates it as books are borrowed, returned, or added. User accounts, including student and staff profiles, can be managed using the LMS. Additionally, the LMS handles book borrowing, returning and reserving transactions for students.

•	User Management: Managing user accounts, including student and staff profiles. The library management system allows students and patrons to borrow, return, and reserve books. It calculates fines for overdue books and records all transactions. Users can donate books to the library, and the system keeps a record of donations.

•	Transaction Handling: Allowing students to borrow, return, and reserve books, with automatic fine calculation for overdue books. Students can borrow books from the library and the system records all transactions. Books can be reserved if unavailable, and fines are automatically calculated based on overdue periods.

•	Donation Management: Enabling users to donate books to the library. Students or other library patrons can donate books to the library. The system records these donations and updates the collection accordingly. This enables each user(student) to be in multiple roles in the database.


## Conclusion
The Library Management System project is designed to streamline the process of managing library resources, delivering a more efficient and effective experience to both librarians and students. The project includes a range of features, such as a user-friendly interface, role-based access control, and automatic fine calculations, which all work together to enhance the overall library experience. 
By providing a more intuitive system, library users can easily navigate the resources available to them, while librarians can manage the collection and activities more efficiently. I believe that this project will be an invaluable addition to educational institutions and libraries, enabling them to provide a more seamless and productive experience for everyone involved.
